## 作业（part 1 of 2）

Write out variables x, y and z in binary code　　

1) int8_t x = 67; int8_t y = -7; int8_t z = y - x;


　　( x=0100,0011; y=1111,1001;z=1011,0110(均使用补码)均无溢出)


2) int8_t x = 0xd3; 
　　

　　( x=1101,0011(此处为二进制码) 溢出)


3) uint8_t = 0xd3;


　　( x=1101,0011(此处为二进制码) 无溢出)


4) int8_t x = 127; int8_t y = -7; int8_t z = y – x;


　　( x=0111,1111;y=1111,1001;z=1000,0001,0000,0110(此处为原码) x,y均无溢出、z溢出)


5) float x = 1.125;


　　( x=1.0010(此处为二进制码) 无精度误差)


6) float x = 23.0;


　　( x=0001,0111(此处为二进制码) 无精度误差)


7) float x = 0.45;


　　( x=0.01110011001100...(此处为二进制码有精度误差)



上述代码中，哪些出现溢出错误，哪些出现精度误差。

*使用维基百科，解释以下概念。*

1)Method of complements : 

　　In mathematics and computing, 
*the method of complements* is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers.The method of complements can be extended to other number bases (radices); in particular, it is used on most digital computers to perform subtraction, represent negative numbers in base 2 or binary arithmetic and test underflow and overflow in calculation.

2)Byte ：

　　The *byte* is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures.


3)Integer (computer science) :

　　In computer science, an *integer* is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers. Computer hardware, including virtual machines, nearly always provide a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer.

4)Floating point :

　　In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision.

*仔细阅读” Method of complements”的内容，你将注意到nines‘ complement in the decimal 和 ones’ complement in binary 等概念.*

1)请证明：二进制的负数（two‘s complement of X）等于 X 的 ones’complement ＋ 1（即，X每位求反加1）

2)Int8_t x = - 017; 请用8进制描述变量 x。

*在c中017即(017)8 阅读维基百科” Two‘s complement”的内容，特别是Sign extension小节内容。*

1)C程序：int8_t x = -0x1f; int y = x; 请用16进制描述变量 x 和 y，并说明 int
y = x 的计算过程。
2)请用数学证明，为什么可以这么计算。

阅读维基百科” Floating point”的内容，

1) NaN 是什么？


　　In computing, **NaN**, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations. Systematic use of NaNs was introduced by the IEEE 754 floating-point standard in 1985, along with the representation of other non-finite quantities like infinities.



　　Two separate kinds of NaNs are provided, termed quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs. Quiet NaNs are used to propagate errors resulting from invalid operations or values, whereas signaling NaNs can support advanced features such as mixing numerical and symbolic computation or other extensions to basic floating-point arithmetic. For example, 0/0 is undefined as a real number, and so represented by NaN; the square root of a negative number is imaginary, and thus not representable as a real floating-point number, and so is represented by NaN; and NaNs may be used to represent missing values in computations.
