**Truth Table:**

| A | B | Y |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

3)Draw a circuit diagram corresponding to the following Boolean expression: (A + B)(B + C)


4)Show the behavior of the following circuit with a truth table:


5)What is circuit equivalence? Use truth table to prove the following formula.
(AB)’ = A’ + B’
